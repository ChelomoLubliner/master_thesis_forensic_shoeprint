# MSc. Thesis: Improving  spatial modeling of randomly acquired characteristics on outsoles 

For the Statistical part of the thesis please reference to this repository : https://github.com/ChelomoLubliner/rac-intensity

- Please consider the code detail document.
- There are two datasets, the old and the new. You can choose which dataset dataset to work with in globals.py file with OLD_DATASET = True/False 
- To run this code :
    - Download the project
    - Create a new virtual environment (optional)
    - Open command prompt and write these commands:
        - VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT_PATH\Scripts\activate
        - pip install -r PROJECT_PATH\distance_RAC_contour_shoeprint\requirements.txt
        - cd PROJECT_PATH\distance_RAC_contour_shoeprint
        - python main.py
- The files active_contour_snake and distance_extremities take the longest time to execute.
- The total runtime takes a few hours.
