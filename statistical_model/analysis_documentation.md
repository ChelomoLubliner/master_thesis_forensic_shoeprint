## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline

The analysis begins with raw shoe print data consisting of:
- **387 shoe prints** (386 with RACs, excluding shoe 127)
- **307Ã—395 pixel resolution** per shoe
- **Contact surface data** with police stamp removal
- **RAC location coordinates** in standardized coordinate system

### Key Algorithms

#### 1. Coordinate Transformation
```r
aspix_x(x, col_shoe=307, rel_col_shoe=150, rel_x_cord=0.25)
aspix_y(y, row_shoe=395, rel_row_shoe=300, rel_Y_cord=0.5)
```
Converts real-world coordinates to pixel positions within the relevant shoe area.

#### 2. Stamp Removal Algorithm
- Identifies cumulative contact surfaces appearing in >8 shoes
- Calculates upper and lower bounds to isolate authentic contact areas
- Removes police identification stamps from analysis

#### 3. Distance Calculations
- **Minimum Distance**: Euclidean distance to nearest contour point
- **Horizontal Distance**: Distance along horizontal axis to contour
- **Binary Categorization**: Distance threshold at 0.1 units

#### 4. Case-Control Sampling
- **Cases**: All pixels containing RACs (n_Acc = 1)
- **Controls**: 20 randomly selected non-RAC pixels per shoe
- Ensures balanced dataset for statistical modeling

### Statistical Modeling Framework

#### Model Types Implemented

1. **NEW_X_NS_XY**: Advanced model with natural cubic splines for X,Y coordinates
2. **NS_XY**: Standard spline model for spatial coordinates
3. **NS_HORIZ**: Horizontal distance-based spline model
4. **NS_MIN**: Minimum distance-based spline model

#### Mixed-Effects Approach
- **Fixed Effects**: Spatial coordinates, distance measures, spline terms
- **Random Effects**: Shoe-level variation to account for individual shoe characteristics
- **Libraries**: `lme4` for mixed-effects modeling, `splines` for basis functions

### Contour Detection Methods

#### Active Contour Algorithm
- Advanced boundary detection using active contour models
- Provides precise shoe outline boundaries
- Better handling of irregular shapes

#### Convex Hull Method
- Simpler geometric approach using convex hull
- Faster computation but less precise boundaries
- Useful for comparison and validation

## Key Findings and Applications
